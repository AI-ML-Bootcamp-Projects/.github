## Overview:

A place where we can collaborate on and share bootcamp projects/ assignments and beyond.

If you are new to GitHub please consider a brief ['Introduction to GitHub'](https://lab.github.com/) course created by The GitHub Training Team.

As per ['Preparing the project for Git'](https://github.com/adobiss/github-upload/issues/2) it is recommended to **avoid adding binary files** (spreadsheets, presentations with slides, videos) to repositories. If you have to add a binary file it is recommneded to also **add it to .gitignore.**
